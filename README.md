### GluonRank: Your Choice of Deep Learning for Ranking

GluonRank is a toolkit that enables easy implementation of collaborative filtering models using neural networks, to help your prototyping of state of the art ranking systems.


## ToDo

- [ ] Get running with multiple categorical features, maintain performance when reducing to a single one
- [ ] Increase the efficiency of the evaluation function
- [ ] Gracefully handle missing continuous embedding or categorical variables & user/item biases
- [ ] Do not require user to index their embedding values for a single matrix 
- [ ] Negative sampling without collisions results in 5X training time. Speed this up!

- [x] Build ranking function as network method
- [ ] Create hosted docs
- [ ] Create python package

## Features

- [ ] Allow for sampling more than one negative per interaction
- [ ] Allow for feedback that can be in the form of 0, 1 or -1. (eg swiping data)

## Ideas

- hmmm
